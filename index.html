				<h2>Article: How CI/CD looks to a beginner.</h2>
				<p>This article will be describing my first forays into CI/CD. One of my favorite quotes that I feel describe the approach I appreciate the most in mostly all endeavours is:</p>
				<figure>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="indent">In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there may be bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You detect this, and take account of it, by distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through argument. The more "objective" a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly ask you to take this or that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by frank confession of it.</p>
					</blockquote>

				And although this quote is talking about empirical science, I've seen that if it is generalized, the principle of being aware of your assumptions could yield a lot of benefits. What do I have to support this? Just a feeling. And a bunch of experiences in my personal life.
				I will be doing the same here, to the best of my abilities.
				<p class="indent">Now, to tackle this topic, I must address first why would a beginner be attracted to CI/CD? Well, it started out for me as an interest in open source, and wanting to contribute, to get something on my resume, while trying to get a job. Now, I've heard CI/CD being used in multiple contexts, but never even bothered to know what it stands for, let alone knowing what it is about. But then came open source for me, and my initial idea was: <em>let's find an open repository with a topic I'm interested in, that's approachable, not too easy, but not too difficult as well.</em> And boy, was I mistaken to think that. Let alone finding an repository who's idea resonates with myself, I couldn't understand what most of the repositories were even about! So much jargon, very specialized uses. And of the few that I understood, I felt they were a bit too difficult for me. But then I blamed myself for being too ignorant, and thought: <em>might as well try to tackle it, and detangle all of this terminology one by one till I can make coherent sense of things.</em> Enter problem number two: I couldn't find where the source code is! Most repositories actually organize their code, and don't put all related files in one folder, and sometimes follow the conventions of whatever framework or language they are using, something which didn't click to me at first, and took me a while to take note of. </p>
